 Twitter Sentiment Analysis
The objective of this project is to detect hate speech in tweets. We say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is NOT racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

Data Files
train.csv - For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet. There is 1 test file (public)

test_tweets.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.
